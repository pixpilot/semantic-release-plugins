# semantic-release

> A modern TypeScript monorepo managed with pnpm and TurboRepo.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Development

Build all packages:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Run tests:

```sh
pnpm test
```

pnpm lint
pnpm format

### Create a New Package

Generate a new package in the monorepo:

## ðŸ“¦ Packages

### [semantic-release-require-config](./packages/semantic-release-require-config/README.md)

A utility for semantic-release workflows that ensures a release config file is present in your package before running semantic-release. This is especially useful in monorepos or strict release environments, helping prevent accidental releases without explicit configuration.
